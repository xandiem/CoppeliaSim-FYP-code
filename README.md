# coppeliasim_pythonic_api

This repository provides a Pythonic API for the CoppeliaSim robotics simulator based on their b0 interface.

## Installation

1. Download CoppeliaSim from [their website](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/ubuntuVersions) and uncompress the compressed tarball in an appropriate directory.

2. Edit your `.bashrc` file and add the following lines (**make sure you adapt the path in the first of the five lines accordingly**).
After editing the file, make sure that the changes are applied (if you are not sure about how to do that, just log off and log back in).
```
export COPPELIASIM_ROOT=/home/USER/software/coppeliasim
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$COPPELIASIM_ROOT
export QT_QPA_PLATFORM_PLUGIN_PATH=$COPPELIASIM_ROOT
alias coppeliasim="cd $COPPELIASIM_ROOT; bash coppeliaSim.sh"
export B0_RESOLVER="tcp://127.0.0.1:22000"
```
3. The latest version of CoppeliaSim has a [minor bug](https://forum.coppeliarobotics.com/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=8387) that we have to fix.
Type the following two commands in the command line:
```
cd $COPPELIASIM_ROOT
sed -i 's/function LoadModel(/function LoadModelFromFile(/g' lua/b0RemoteApiServer.lua
```
3.1 The latest version of CoppeliaSim has has another, less frequent [minor bug](https://forum.coppeliarobotics.com/viewtopic.php?t=8378)
It is fixed by removing the Vortex plugin from the CoppeliaSim folder:
```
cd $COPPELIASIM_ROOT
rm libsimExtDynamicsVortex.so
```

4. We want to automatically start Coppelia's b0 interface automatically with the simulator.
To do that, use the following commands:
```
cd $COPPELIASIM_ROOT
mv lua/b0RemoteApiServer.lua simAddOnScript_b0RemoteApiServer.lua
```


## Description of the API provided

The API provided is composed of one main class and some auxiliary ones.
The main class is called `CoppeliaSimAPI` and provides some methods which are already provided by the b0 version of CoppeliaSim API, plus some additional methods.

The following is a list of the methods which are already provided as part of CoppeliaSim b0 API. If you have any doubts about what they do, please check the [original documentation](https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/b0RemoteApi-python.htm):
```
  start(self) ###
  stop(self) ###
  get_objects_children(parent, children_type='sim.handle_all') ###
  get_object_name(object_handle, alternative_name='') ###
  create_model(model, x, y, z, rz) ###
  get_object_handle(object_name) ###
  set_object_position(obj, x, y, z) ###
  set_object_orientation(obj, lst) ###
  remove_object(obj) ###
  run_script(script) ###
  close(self) ###
```

Additionally, the `CoppeliaSimAPI` class provides the following methods:

- `set_object_transform(obj, x, y, z, anglez)` Allows setting the position and orientation using a single call.
- `create_human(x, y, z, angle)` Creates a _cylinder following human_. You can move the human by moving the cylinder.
- `create_wall(p1, p2)` Creates a wall from `p1` to `p2`, where both are lists containing the x, y, z coordinates of the ends of the wall.
- `scale_object(handle, sx, sy, sz)`: Scales the given object, using `sx`, `sy` and `sz` as the ratios.
